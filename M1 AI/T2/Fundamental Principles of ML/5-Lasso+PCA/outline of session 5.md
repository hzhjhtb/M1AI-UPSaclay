Friday, dec 3rd.

In the Lecture, we will :
- quickly define Elastic-Net, which we forgot to do last time
- say one more word about MAP (& "graphical models")
- cover PCA (and answer questions about MAP, if there are, of course)

In the tutorial (planned to be long), we will:
- complete exercises 3.4.b and 3.5.a+b of  `TD-regularizations.pdf`
- do naive implementations of Ridge and Lasso regressions in `TP5.1-coding your own Lasso-subject.ipynb`,
- (if there is time) : code your PCA from scratch in `TP5.2-PCA-from-scratch+overfitting-correction.ipynb` (+do other things with PCA if you're fast)
