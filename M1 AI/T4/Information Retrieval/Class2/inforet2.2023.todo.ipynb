       "'Education & Reference Higher Education (University +)After getting my bachelors how long does it take to get a doctorate? In my last year of my bachelors degree in psychology and I want to get a doctorate. But I have no idea how long it would take. And is it better to get a masters a doctorate? Follow 6 answers Answers Relevance Rating Newest Oldest Best Answer: It generally takes 2 years to complete a master\\'s and after that I would say at least 3-4 to complete a Ph. D. although many doctorates take much longer than that: sometimes up to 6-8 years. Unless you\\'re trying to get into a unique medical field, such as virology or epidemiology etc., or to work/teach at the college level, then a master\\'s degree will suffice for the most part. In fact, some colleges employ professors who hold a Masters degree and don\\'t have a doctorate. also fyi, for every 100 Ph. D.\\'s rewarded to a person, there are fewer than 10 collegiate job openings :). Hope that helped :)dvd_clapp · 10 years ago0 1 Comment Asker\\'s rating Many universities allow BA/BS holders to matriculate directly into a doctoral program. Watch out though, some offer the Ph D, while others have the Psy D. The credential is different. The former is more theoretical and research oriented, while the latter is more clinical. I used to work at a college that had AAS and BA degrees. We enrolled students into the AAS, then graduated them and enrolled them into the BA. The AAS was not enough to get a job in the field. They got out of synch really fast. My story here is not for grad school, but honestly, the same principle applies. When you are considering ang graduate degree, take the time to really discuss your plans and goals with not only the admissions person, but the faculty and department chair. They wiill be able to guide you best. Good luck with your search for information. Anonymous · 10 years ago0 0 Comment It takes anywhere from four to eight years. I got mine in four years. You usually have two to three years of classes, a written exam after the second year (mine was two days long), an oral exam after the third year and then you write your dissertation. The dissertation is the big unknown. I wrote mine in two years, but I know people who took much longer. If you are doing clinical psychology, it could take longer, because you may need to do clinical training. Someone suggested getting a Master\\'s first. I do not recommend this unless you can\\'t get into a good program. The better schools do not accept terminal master\\'s students. Source (s): University Professor Ranto · 10 years ago0 0 Comment I would recommend getting a Masters first, then doctorate. I have my Masters in Education and it took me less than two years. It was just a bunch of classes and a thesis. For a doctorate you have to have a research plan and more classes and tons of work and the Masters will really prepare you for the hard work that earning a doctorate entails. Good luck!Maddog Mommy · 10 years ago0 1 Comment It depends on so many things, like what your research is going to be on and how picky your advisors are. 4-6 years is about normal. Secondly, a doctorate is for people who want to be scholars and actively research for the rest of their careers. masters is less research oriented, and is better suited for people who want \"real world\" hands on experience rather than just doing academic research. Good luck. You could probably contact the schools that you are applying to and ask them how long thier students take on average to complete the degrees. Each school will be different.

    "However, if we switch our evaluation metric to p@100, we may need to consider different hyperparameter settings since the most important factor for p@10, which is the number of relevant documents retrieved in the top 10, may not be as crucial. It may be worth experimenting with larger values of ngram_range and possibly adjusting the hyperparameters above to optimize for p@100."
